Prompt - The prompt is text input passed to the model 

Prompt Design / Prompt Engineering - The art & science of figuring out what text to feed your language model to get it to take on the behavior desired 

Zero-shot prompt - The model is given a natural language descripton of the task, and it is expected to learn the task from this description alone

One-shot prompt: The model is provided with one example to the LLM within the prompt to give some guidance on what type of response you want 

Few-shot prompt: Few-shot prompts are similar to one-shot prompts, but the model is given multiple labeled examples of the task

Tuning - The process of adapting a model to a new domain or set of custom use cases by training the model on new data 

Two different ways of Tuning - Prompt tuning  & Model tuning (also known as Fine tuning) 

Prompt Design -> Engineered Prompt 

Parameter Efficient Tuning -> Tunable Soft Prompt 

Fine Tuning -> Tunable Pre-trained Model -> Costly
